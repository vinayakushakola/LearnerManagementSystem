Hello Sir,
So today i am going to show you my project ie Learner Management System basically My project is all about handling the Hired Candidate Information From joining date to 
Completing the fellowship program.
So in this project first i created an Admin System
In which first Admin have to register his account then he will be able to add candidates information into our server.
So for this i created an Registration Api
Login Api
Update Admin Account Api
Delete Admin Account Api
N Aslo Forgot password n reset password api which is basically use to change the password of the admin

After this We move on to the Candidate APIs
In which the first thing is Only Admin can control the candidate information

If the admin is not logged in he is not able to do any changes to the candidate information
If the admin is logged in he can Add An Candidate into our server n delete

This feature is available only when ur logged in.
